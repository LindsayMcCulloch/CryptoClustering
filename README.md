# CryptoClustering
This is the repository for Monash University Data Analytics Bootcamp Module 19 Challenge

## Contents

* `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` Jupyter notebook containing the data query for this challenge
* `.png` images for the visualisations in this ReadMe

**Resources folder**

* `crypto_market_data.csv`csv file that contains the data for this challenge

## Analysis 

**1. What is the best value for `k`?**

K = 4 is the best value based on the below elbow curve

**2. What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?**

0.37701473 + 0.34354479 + 0.17333394 = 0.8938934597944491

**3. What is the best value for `k` when using the PCA data?**

The best value for K is 4

**4. Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?**

No, the best value remains as 4

**5. After visually analysing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?**

After analyzing the cluster results, it can be found that the PCA data resulted in tighter clusters and resulted in more entries within cluster 3 compared to the original scatter data where values were contained in cluster 0

## Instructions 

1. Rename the `Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb` file as `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb`.

2. Load the `crypto_market_data.csv` into a DataFrame.

3. Get the summary statistics and plot the data to see what the data looks like before proceeding.

## Prepare the Data

Use the `StandardScaler()` module from `scikit-learn` to normalize the data from the CSV file.

Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

## Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
Use the elbow method to find the best value for `k` using the following steps:

* Create a list with the number of k values from 1 to 11.

* Create an empty list to store the inertia values.

* Create a `for` loop to compute the inertia with each possible value of `k`.

* Create a dictionary with the data to plot the elbow curve.

* Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of `k` to visually identify the optimal value for `k`.

* Answer the following question in your notebook: What is the best value for `k`?

## Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data

Use the following steps to cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for `k` on the original scaled data:

* Initialise the K-means model with the best value for `k`.

* Fit the K-means model using the original scaled DataFrame.

* Predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the original scaled DataFrame.

* Create a copy of the original data and add a new column with the predicted clusters.

* Create a scatter plot using hvPlot as follows:

    * Set the x-axis as "PC1" and the y-axis as "PC2".

    * Colour the graph points with the labels found using K-means.

    * Add the "coin_id" column in the `hover_cols` parameter to identify the cryptocurrency represented by each data point.

## Optimise Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

* Using the original scaled DataFrame, perform a PCA and reduce the features to three principal components.

* Retrieve the explained variance to determine how much information can be attributed to each principal component and then answer the following question in your notebook:

    * What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?

* Create a new DataFrame with the PCA data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

## Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data

Use the elbow method on the PCA data to find the best value for `k` using the following steps:

* Create a list with the number of k-values from 1 to 11.

* Create an empty list to store the inertia values.

* Create a `for` loop to compute the inertia with each possible value of `k`.

* Create a dictionary with the data to plot the Elbow curve.

* Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of `k` to visually identify the optimal value for `k`.

* Answer the following question in your notebook:
    
    * What is the best value for `k` when using the PCA data?
    
    * Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?

## Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data

Use the following steps to cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for `k` on the PCA data:

* Initialise the K-means model with the best value for `k`.

* Fit the K-means model using the PCA data.

* Predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the PCA data.

* Create a copy of the DataFrame with the PCA data and add a new column to store the predicted clusters.

* Create a scatter plot using hvPlot as follows:
    
    * Set the x-axis as "price_change_percentage_24h" and the y-axis as "price_change_percentage_7d".
    
    * Colour the graph points with the labels found using K-means.

    * Add the "coin_id" column in the hover_cols parameter to identify the cryptocurrency represented by each data point.

* Answer the following question:
    
    * What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
